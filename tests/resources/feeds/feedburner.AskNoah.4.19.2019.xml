				In this weeks episode we air out interview with the OpenPower Foundation.  The OpenPOWER Foundation is an open technical membership organization that will assist data centers in rethinking their approach to technology.  Google, Tyan, Nvidia and Mellanox are all founding members of the OpenPOWER Foundation.  OpenPower is an “open source” model for hardware, launched by IBM.  It's goals are to expand the open innovation to a Chip-System-Software platform relying on the same advantages as Open Source Software.

				I gave her a Logitech BRIO for her birthday, installed Pop!_OS and set her up with OBS so she can stream her nakedness to the world! She uses Flowblade to edit commissions. Everything works. I couldn't be more proud of her: I never have to play tech support.
				
				
				The only problem I've found is the performance of the BRIO's drivers on Linux (UVC) vs Windows. She doesn't get 4k output, which is fine, because who streams a camgirl at 4k right?

Several people raised objections to it, and I was completely open to changing it. But the more objections I see, the more I feel the nature of the objections actually justifies the Covenant as the choice rather than justifies switching it. The more I hear people complain about the "scope of applicability" being outside the project, the more it's apparent that many (not all, but many) simply don't want to need to think about their actions in other contexts. Some will claim that ambiguity will lead to abuse, but the underlying idea is "treat people with respect".

Explicit guidelines have demonstrated success in other projects and other areas of the kernel. Here is a Code of Conduct statement for the wider kernel. It is based on the Contributor Covenant as described at www.contributor-covenant.org From this point forward, we should abide by these rules in order to help make the kernel community a welcoming environment to participate in. </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/pmjones" title="Follow Paul M.

Now consisting of a bi-weekly audio podcast, live streaming audio, community event sponsorship and general outreach, LHS helps to expose ham radio enthusiasts to FOSS and FOSS enthusiasts to ham radio.

GitHub has removed the centerpiece of its faux Oval Office waiting room, a circular mat emblazoned with the phrase, “United Meritocracy of GitHub.”</li><li><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167" title="LKML: Linus Torvalds: Linux 4.19-rc4 released, an apology, and a maintainership note" rel="nofollow">LKML: Linus Torvalds: Linux 4.19-rc4 released, an apology, and a maintainership note</a> &mdash; I actually think that 4.19 is looking fairly good,
				things have gotten to the "calm" period of the release cycle, and I've
				talked to Greg to ask him if he'd mind finishing up 4.19 for me, so
				that I can take a break, and try to at least fix my own behavior.
				</li><li><a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals/90726" title="php.internals: [RFC] [Withdrawn] Adopt Code of Conduct" rel="nofollow">php.internals: [RFC] [Withdrawn] Adopt Code of Conduct</a> &mdash; As to the content of the RFC, when I initially proposed it, I selected the Contributor Covenant due to it being a well adopted standard. Several people raised objections to it, and I was completely open to changing it. But the more objections I see, the more I feel the nature of the objections actually justifies the Covenant as the choice rather than justifies switching it. The more I hear people complain about the "scope of applicability" being outside the project, the more it's apparent that many (not all, but many) simply don't want to need to think about their actions in other contexts. Some will claim that ambiguity will lead to abuse, but the underlying idea is "treat people with respect". And as long as you do that, all will be fine. </li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/linuxs-creator-is-sorry-but-will-he-change/" title="Linux's Creator Is Sorry. But Will He Change? | WIRED" rel="nofollow">Linux's Creator Is Sorry. But Will He Change? | WIRED</a> &mdash; On Sunday, he apologized for years of improper behavior. "My flippant attacks in emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for," Torvalds wrote in an email to the Linux kernel mailing list. "I know now this was not OK and I am truly sorry."</li><li><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f" title="kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source tree" rel="nofollow">kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git - Linux kernel source tree</a> &mdash; The Code of Conflict is not achieving its implicit goal of fostering civility and the spirit of 'be excellent to each other'. Explicit guidelines have demonstrated success in other projects and other areas of the kernel. Here is a Code of Conduct statement for the wider kernel. It is based on the Contributor Covenant as described at www.contributor-covenant.org From this point forward, we should abide by these rules in order to help make the kernel community a welcoming environment to participate in. </li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/pmjones" title="Follow Paul M.

Originally begun to help amateur radio operators move from Microsoft and other closed-source operating systems and applications over to Linux and Free Software, the show has broadened its scope. Now consisting of a bi-weekly audio podcast, live streaming audio, community event sponsorship and general outreach, LHS helps to expose ham radio enthusiasts to FOSS and FOSS enthusiasts to ham radio. Join us every other Monday night for the live broadcast, subscribe with your favorite podcatcher, and visit with us at your local ham fest or FOSS convention. We are Linux, ham radio and Open Source for EVERYONE.</li><li><a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/6926" title="Social Justice Attack Survival Guide | Paul M. Jones" rel="nofollow">Social Justice Attack Survival Guide | Paul M. Jones</a> &mdash; With the recent Social Justice capture of the Linux kernel, many in the open source world may find this guide from Vox Day to be useful. I present it here as a public service; you can find the original PDF here. If you are interested in how to resist the introduction of the Contributor Convenant and other Social Justice derived Codes of Conduct, you may wish to watch this presentation or see the slides for it.</li></ul>

We invite Kenny Schmidt, a 17 year old who is starting out with Linux and ask that question.

				We talk quite a bit about owning your communication and how you can do that with Ham Radio. What if you love your Linux and want to continue to use your computer to communicate? This week we dive into an all new way to use ham radio, all on Linux, all with open source software. We take a call from a a caller who wants to automate his door lock, a caller who wants to replace quicken and Noah dives into why it’s important to have a central home automation system.

				This week we talk about the new release of Ubuntu 17.04, take a deep dive into the “right to repair” bill that is sweeping 11 states &amp; the newest player in the social media space, Mastodon.

				Ubuntu 17.04: The bittersweet Linux release (http://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-17-04-the-bittersweet-linux-release/)
				The company dropped its smartphone and tablet plans. This, in turn, ended to its plans to make Unity its universal default interface. Instead, Gnome will become Ubuntu's once and future desktop. Days later, long-time CEO Jane Silber resigned in favor of the company's founder Mark Shuttleworth.
				11 States Considereing Right To Repair (https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/there-are-now-11-states-considering-bills-to-protect-your-right-to-repair-electronics)
				The bills would require manufacturers to sell replacement parts to consumers and independent repair companies and would also require them to open source diagnostic manuals. It would also give independent repair professionals the ability to bypass software locks that prevent repairs, allowing them to return a gadget back to its factory settings.
				Right to repair advocates are looking at this movement as a perhaps decade-long process that will require a grassroots movement of consumers to push back against the long-entrenched repair monopolies of companies like Apple, John Deere, and video game console manufacturers.

				This week on the Ask Noah Show we dive straight into the Ubuntu dropping Unity news story, talk about the best open source messenger application &amp; of course take your questions live on the air.
				--  The Cliff Notes --
				Ubuntu Unity is Dead: Desktop will switch back to Gnome next year (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/ubuntu-unity-is-dead-desktop-will-switch-back-to-gnome-next-year/)
				Six years after making Unity the default user interface on Ubuntu desktops, Canonical is giving up on the project and will switch the default Ubuntu desktop back to GNOME next year. Canonical is also ending development of Ubuntu software for phones and tablets, spelling doom for the goal of creating a converged experience with phones acting as desktops when docked with the right equipment.
				Staff, Projects, Shed as Ubuntu Maker Tries to Lure Investors (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/06/canonical_cuts_jobs_with_unity_bullet/)
				On Wednesday, we reported that Ubuntu is killing off its never-delivered Unity 8 technology and switching back to GNOME for its desktop user interface. Today, The Reg has learned that Canonical has axed more than half the team who worked on Unity – which was an effort to build a single Ubuntu UI spanning phones, tablets, PCs and other devices.
				Those Unity staffers who couldn't be found suitable jobs elsewhere in the open-source shop are being let go. Jobs are also going in other parts of the organization. The cuts came after Canonical founder and millionaire Mark Shuttleworth's decision to seek potential outside investors. These investors determined that Canonical was overstaffed and some projects lacked focus.
				Mark Shuttleworth Reportedly Returning To Role As Canonical CEO (http://phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Mark-Shuttleworth-CEO-Return)
				I'm now told directly by a confidant that Jane Silber is likely stepping down with Mark Shuttleworth taking over as CEO. Mark had been CEO of Canonical from 2004 to 2010 until Jane Silber took over as CEO. Mark had originally stepped down from being the CEO to focus on product design, partnerships, customers, and other areas. Silber had been with Canonical since 2004 where she was serving in other roles, including as COO.
				Open Sourcing Wire Server Code (https://medium.com/@wireapp/open-sourcing-wire-server-code-ef7866a731d5)
				“Open sourcing was always part of our initial plan and it took some time to reach this stage. We decided to take the open source path because transparency and community engagement is of utmost importance for any product that has security at its core.”
				The team is now taking the next step to also open source the Wire server code. Wire app client code, encryption protocol and end-to-end encrypted integrations API are already available on GitHub.

				This week on the Ask Noah Show we kick things off by taking a deep dive into the anti-privacy bill that is expected to be signed by President Trump.
				We also tell you about the layout and format of the show &amp; what to expect. Then take calls about microphone levels for podcasting, routers, NATs, Privacy &amp; more!
				— The Cliff Notes —
				Unifi UAP AC Pro (http://amzn.to/2nxN5Fn)
				Deploy the UniFi AC Pro AP indoors or outdoors, in wireless networks requiring maximum performance. Sporting a weatherproof design, the UniFi AC Pro AP features simultaneous, dual-band, 3x3 MIMO technology and convenient 802.3af PoE/802.3at PoE+ compatibility.
				Symetrix 528e Voice Processor (http://amzn.to/2n5IA9C)
				The 528Eis a complete, self-contained voice processor that performs six separate functions: microphone preamplification, de-essing (sibilance removal), compression/limiting, downward expansion, parametric EQ, and voice symmetry alignment. All six processors may be used simultaneously. Although we call the 528E Features:Works with any microphone (or line input)Enhances vocal intelligibility Increases perceived loudness and "presence"Great for voices as well as instruments and effects Reduces off-mic noise Reliable, proven design
				Private Internet Access Tested in Court (https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-no-logging-claims-tested-in-fbi-case-160312/)
				While many VPN providers say they do not log their users' activities in order to protect anonymity, it's not often their claims get tested in the wild. However, a criminal complaint filed by the FBI this week notes that a subpoena sent to Private Internet Access resulted in no useful data being revealed about a suspected hoaxer.
